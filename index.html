                  The film begins in Kansas, which is depicted in a sepia tone. Dorothy Gale lives with her dog, Toto, on her Aunt Em and Uncle
                  Henry's farm. Toto gets in trouble with a mean neighbor, Miss Almira Gulch, when he bites her. However, Dorothy's family
                  and the farmhands are all too busy to listen to her troubles. Miss Gulch produces an order from the sheriff allowing her
                  to have Toto put down. She takes him away, but he escapes and returns to Dorothy who, fearing that Miss Gulch will return,
                  decides to run away from home.

                   After some miles Dorothy and Toto encounter Professor Marvel, a kindly fortune teller who, realizing Dorothy has run away,
                  uses his crystal ball to convince her that Aunt Em is ill. Dorothy races home just as a tornado approaches. Locked out of
                  the storm cellar, she seeks safety in the house, where a wind-blown window sash knocks her out. She awakens to find the tornado
                  has sent the house spinning into the sky. Outside the window during the flight she and Toto see farm animals, an old lady
                  knitting in a chair, two men rowing a boat, and finally Miss Gulch, who transforms into a cackling witch riding a broomstick.
